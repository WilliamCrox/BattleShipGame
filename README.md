The game is a classic two-player, one-grid game for each player. The rules
of the game are as follows:

• Each player holds a grid of 10x10 squares representing the sea, and on which
places a set of five ships (which make up his fleet).
• Ship pieces are one grid square wide and various lengths and
represent different types of warships such as aircraft carriers, battleships
and underwater.
• Each player's fleet consists of 5 types of ships (Aircraft Carrier, Destroyer, Frigate,
Corvette, Submarine) whose lengths are 5, 4, 3, 3 and 2.
• At the start (game setup phase), ships must be placed horizontally or vertically on
grid.
• After each player has randomly placed their ships on their grid, the game begins. In
at this point, each player does not know where the other player has placed their ships.

Players take turns "shooting" at the other player's grid, choosing a spot on
grid. The attacked player must reveal (announce) if one of his ships
is in the grid position where the other player is shooting. When a ship is hit in all the
squares of it, then it is considered destroyed. Players take turns attacking o
each other until one player has lost all his ships, at which point the other player wins
naval battle.
